notes:

1. in GraphQL, all types are nullable by default!
2. to get object from mutation with saving: return a promise, resolve with the product!
3. urql - results.stale crucial for having up to date db data! 
[server.js & SingleBookmark -> favicon test on click]
[server.js & testMutation -> adding additional data through middleware and passing to graphql resolver test]


 issues:
 
 DONE 2. working graphql playground DONE
 DONE 3. adding user doesn't return anything on graphql playground? (but it returns in changeSettings) (see notes pt.2) DONE
 DONE 5. bookmarkSchema.ts: is <Array> type enough? [string] DONE 
 DONE 3. id: string | number or string only? unify with client (client: string only) DONE
 DONE 4. client: SingleTabData: [object] | never[] | [] ????
 XX 6. userSchema gets ref to settingsSchema, should it be also the other war around? (ref to settingsSchema is no more there)XX
   <- not being used actually in the client? (items deleted from rss clientside) DONE
 DONE 8. client: ALL_TAGS should not be an id but rather deletable property should be used! ids will be added automatically be database DONE
 DONE 9. deleteUser -> promise.all should be used instead of individual promises? for performance DONE
XXX 11. deleteTabMutation -> should it also delete related Bookmark automatically? NO -> bookmarks still remain in All folderXX
 
 DONE 14. non-null types: same everywhere! (nonnulles deleted for consitency - loginmut, revoketoken, probable should be implemented partially) DONE
 ?? 15. fields -> id can be an argument even if it is never used? delete it from fields? (fields are fnot only for args)??
 DONE 16. upserts in changeMutations -> should be false mostly? (all false )DONE
DONE 16. make npm run dev open 2 console instances (no changes, npm-run-all worked once tested) DONE 
 DONE 18. client: comment out useStorage (zustand's perist commented out) DONE
DONE 18. Column: better error handling? (plain error.message in COlumn & others)DONE
X 19. bookmarks: better query -> finding the bookmarks matched to a particular tab right away (no point?) X
XXX 22. use zustand state conditionally if the user is not authenticated. no, zustand state is always on, even if user is authenticated, is just not used in that case XX
DONE 21. unhandled promise rejections! addUser, - not encountered it anymore
  good practice-> calling reject with error -> done, returns after reject commented out
DONE 23. delete testUserId in the end DONE
  .catch after reject -> unhandled promise rejections should dissapear, tried but catch on undefined errors happened, see #230DONE
DONE 24. client: rss settings merges with global settings -> test -> delete all commented out code DONE
DONE 27. globalSettings & single rss settings make it impossible to enter a value other than 5-15! DONE
DONE 28. client: make + & - for rss itemsPerPage  DONE
XX 29. Main -> fetching and date are after useEffects (globalSettings in a useEffect dep) but globalSettings is declared already?
(no img fetchcin in Main anymore, img taken from settings in MainWrapper)) XX
DONE 30. globalSettings taken either from props or from hooks (hooks cannot apply if useEffect uses globalSettings
+ it requires more code) -> unify? -> currently hook is in MainWrapper & Column  (MainWrapper only now)DONE
DONE 32. clientside: hooks for store -> sometimes it's state.tabs, sometimes store.tabs -> unify -> unified as store DONE
??? 33. take care of state other that settings, tabs & bookmarks (use of existings queries should be enough?) ???
 DONE 34. mutations -> proper typescript types! DONE
 DONE? 35. client-side: unify column_1 naming with server-side naming (colColor_1 itp) when the client-side code
 will be working again for nonauthorised user! (colColor everywhere?) ?DONE
?? 36. addBookmark -> tabQueries should be refetched?
 (no need? bookmarks are being filterd in Tab by tags instead, bookmarkAllTags is taking care of empty folders) ??
?? 37. way to use urql as a central state? ??
DONE 38. editBookmark doesn't work on the client! DONE
DONE 39. objCreators: too much repetition in db tab creators? DONE
DONE 40. tabIdsUsedByBookmarks -> change it (it should be a list of all tabs ids that are bookmarks tags tabIdsUsedByBookmarks) or use mongoose query!!!! DONE
?? 41. newTab -> no color as argument, should be null (createBasicTabs already provides color: null) ??
?? 42. editing Tab -> bookmarks are not sorted alphabetically! (tested -> should be sorted just right)??
DONE 43. Tab (and other components further down?) should take tab data from Column (context??), not from db? (data taken from dbContext)DONE
DONE 45. logic for tab deletion in Grid work only thanks to setTimeout() [in Boomark_lowerUI] -> make it better!!! DONE (result.stale used!!!)
??45. memory leaks? when adding bookmark (tested - not occured) ??
DONE 46. bookmark /tabs database interfaces everywhere! (now both from context) DONE
DONE 47. promise.all -> no need for new Promise everywhere? mutation return promises (change in Bookmark_lowerUI, no promise.all in Grids now, ) DONE
DONE 47.5 useBookmarks & useTabs -> mark which methods are used server-side! DONE
XX 48. explain somewhere to the user why disable drag & drop is there (will be incluted in initial note) XX
DONE 49. rss -> still not working because of CORS, fetch them server side? DONE
DONE 50. server.ts -> figure out which cors urls are actually needed
 (no need to include every route - only origin - scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port) DONE
 DONE 52. change app.use to app.get / app.post?
  (change in case of RSS. app.use is meant for binding middleware, get post etc. to handling a specific route ) DONE
DONE 53. change server file upload logic to graphql? DONE
DONE 54. move backgroundImg logic from server.js? (multer.ts created in utils) DONE
XX 56. clientside: make it possible to choose backgroundImg colors also from settings?
 or close the modal and open backgroundColors menu (columns colors are on the left anyway)XX
DONE 57. is path module needed? (server.js (yes)DONE
DONE 58. status 201 (all statuses in server.ts updated)DONE
DONE 59. graphql for file upload? use middleware which should detect if the file is attached to post req DONE
DONE 62. upload background img -> should use one btn only?? DONE
DONE 63. cannot upload image if there are spaces in the file name? spaces replaced by "_" DONE
DONE 66. background img - remove it once the user is deleted? implemented already -test it! {recursive: true} added DONE
DONE 67. delete all test mutation code in the end DONE
DONE 69. delete unused test_svgs (for alt links), rename the chosen one DONE
?? 70. singleBookmarkData: change interface to BookmarkDatabase_i ?
 (interface for bookmarks is being changed but there maybe problems, see other notes) ??
XX 71. msg to user when clicking custom img and there is none present (file browser starts instead) XX
DONE 72. graphql ID vd string type, they may be mixed DONE
DONE 75. fetchFavicon in server.js -> delete & uninstall? (an API in SingleBookmark used instead) DONE
? 75. Main -> change context values obj, so it is taken from state directly (done already?) ?
DONE 73. user creation: check if user name or email already exists DONE
DONE 74. implement token versioning: refreshToken DONE
XX 76. AppWrapper, MainWrapper in different placec - chaos? no AppWrapper anymore XX
XXX 77. UpperRightMenu: loggedInState -> change for it to be compatible with authContext (auth is taken from zustand now) XX
X78. middleware for token -> generated code for types is being used? (probably not - types taken from types package?)X
DONE 79. is case of failure, accessToken will be an empty string
 - to change? compare with loginMutation (only refresh token can be "") DONE
DONE 81. logout mutation: is refreshing site -why? (not anymore, probably because is going to modal firs?) DONE
DONE 82. uninstall react-tracked DONE
??  84. user exp not perfect when logging out? flickering (no longer the case)  ?? 
DONE 85. Profile & LoginRegister doubled components (Profile & Profile_input deleted)DONE
DONE !86. change initial load to localhost3000/ !  (client - package.json homepage changed to "/")DONE
?? 87. auth error - no user or no password - shouln't be separate errors! (Message for login changed)??
DONE 88. isAuth -> ts errors (RequestWithAuth interface added) DON
DONE 89. deleting all data when a user is deleted! done already?
 check (works except for the backgroundImg, see #61) DONE
DONE 90. option to delete account? DONE
xxx 91. some img should be created as a custom image in the moment new user is created?
(instead clicking "custom image" opens window for file browsing)) xxx 
DONE 92. currently -> not authenticated -> test user from db is used -> change it to client only demo DONE
DONE 93. notes on queries/schema/mongo etc. DONE
DONE 94. Main, BackgroundSettings_Upload -> backgroundImgKey -> code not used anymore -> delete?
(backgroundImgKey was used for context, query from db instead of context now, contex deleted) DONE
DONE 95. unify rssFetch & backgroundFetch serverside -> errors etc.  DONE
DONE 98. delete data -> rssExample DONE
DONE 99. server.ts -> make separate files (params has to be in a route!,
 for backgroundImg see #254, backgroundUpload - middleware, not a route) DONE
 DONE 100. server.txs -> rootValue -> is it needed? see notes DONE
!!! DONE 103. unify callback functions -> function declaration instead of () => { }everywherw in JSX?
 (changed to function reference in few cases) DONE !!!
DONE 102  react keys -> they should by indices ! change to id (indices for bookmars and tabs changed) DONE
DONE 105. delete the other background image (post route? deleted ) DONE
DONE 106. make it possible to changle background img when not logged in, again DONE
DONE 107 (pushed - see other notes about backgroundIMgMut first). write notes for file upload system! DONE
DONE 108. not possible to write even a console.log in backgroundImgMutation even while is working? (backgroundImgMutation resolve
is not being used - that is how UploadFileType work?) DONE
DONE 109. backgroundImgUpload funcion -> for !req.body is next() needed? (yes, following code is not executed if there is no body) DONE
??112. test user Id server.ts check import??
DONE 113. xxgetting background img automaticallyxx - browse files if there is no user img instead DONE
DONE 114. fallback if no backgroundImg available?
 or test it if it is not broking the app at least (no app breaking, white background) DONE
 ?? 115. backgroundImgQuery -> no variable needed? 
check after implementing unlogged version (? userId obviusly needed)???
DONE 116. useCallback -> is it really needed for uploads? no callback used right now
  (seems to be not needed, see useCallback notes below) DONE
DONE 118. change background upload UI! DONE
DONE 119. BackgroudnSettings_Upload typescript issues (alse the code was modified slightly)DONE
DONE 120. urql query from rss -> archive DONE

DONE 123. custom background img -> should work if there is no file in the beginning? DONE
DONE 124 (pushed after taking care of context). zustand hooks -> delete or implent when logged out?
(useLoggedInState deleted) DONE
? done 125. should refreshToken() return null in case of failure in App.ts?? (returning null now)done ?
DONE 127. implement token revoking !!!! DONE
DONE 132. implement Registration !!! DONE
DONE 133. revokingToken -> "query was already executed: "mixing promises with callback??
(deleted error handling) DONE
DONE 135. LoginSVG -> move to the left? (to the right actually, other svgs also moved) DONE
DONE 136. change name to username everywhere?  (name on the backend, username frontend - changed UserProfile for consistency)DONE
DONE 137. changing between 2 differen users, check user queries DONE !!! User.findById(userId) !!!

DONE 140. x hide/unhide password x password input type instead DONE
DONE 141. deleteUserMutation -> keep it! proper way to delete user by admin (deketeUsersByAdmin now)DONE
DONE 142. mutation.ts -> naming: some with Mutation at the end some not - unify! DONE
DONE 143. upperUiContext -> logic for demo/unlogged version mixed with ui focus logic (does it work?)
UserProfile/LoginRegister -> check upperUiContext dispatches, add descriptions?
(the logic is not mixed in fact, works for both auth and non auth version.
descriptions added, changed one naming
notes about tabEditableOpenable:
  !! tabEditableOpenable -> to solve the problem with tabEditables flickering when closing
       which is visible when backgroundColor modal overlap with tabEditables
       in other cases the tab editables are closed by setting tabOpenedState to null
       both tabOpenedState and tabEditableOpenabe are using individual tab context to close tab editables
       but tabEditablesOpenable is taken from upperUIContext (which contains Main component)
       while tabOpenedState is taken from central state (zustand) -> this probably makes it noticably slower: 
       upperUi change -> tab dispatch vs upperUi change -> change zustand state -> tab dispatch
       same login for color column left as it was (it uses tabOpenedState)
) DONE
DONE 144. clientSide -> change some rendering function to be anonymous inline funcions?? IIFS! (done in LogRegProfile_input) DONE
DONE 147. darker default background img? (change to darker - slight blueGray) DONE
DONE 148. after registering -> automatically fill up username field in Login? DONE
DONE 150. change naming to ByUser & ByAdmin DONE
DONE 151. check if changeUSer "by admin" works DONE (reworked)
DONE153. serverside interfaces are in types files, better interfaces sharing between client and server?
) (settings and basic types for tabs and bookmarks are being taken by server from client) DONE 
DONE 154. UserProfile -> mutations should succeed if there is proper field being send back (done? if there is no
proper fields being return -> generic error) DONE
xxx 156. UserProfile -> no server connection error -> !res may be not the right kind of logic for it? (seems good enough?) xxx
DONE 157. UserProfile -> simplify error logic! less ifs, errors received serverside if no proper data returned DONE
DONE 158. addUserMutation -> change so it distinguish between username and email already present in DB DONE
DONE 159. all or almost all mutations should have error fields? (for now- only those that client can react differently to,forgotPasswordMutation -> better error handling)  DONE
DONE 161. successful register message && successful user deletion- when? DONE (in useAuth zustand hook)
DONE 162. whenever returning to editUser, name & email should be filled again DONE
DONE 163. UserProfile -> setNotification(null) everywhere not needed? (moved to function)DONE
DONE 164. prevent copying new password & pastying in password confirmation  DONE
DONE 165. LoginRegister_input naming change (component also used elsewhere) DONE
! X 166. after implementing forgot password logic -> make sure that it won't work when token is revoked? (
  not needed! revoking tokens is intended to be use for eg. is refreshToken got stolen - this does not mean that the hacker
  has access to users email!) X
! X 169. changeUserByAdmin -> changing password - should it be left out? (NO - in case login password was stolen [
  revokingToken would not be enough, as the db & refreshToken tokenVersion will be again the same after logging in,
  so password has to be change by the admin])X  !
DONE 171. deleteUserByAdminMutation -> change so it is possible to delete many users DONE
DONE 172. deleteUsersByAdminMutation -> not getting proper returned data from graphql, change id naming?
 (mutations was not returnig data matching field, id naming not changed) DONE
DONE 173. deleteUsersByAdminMutation -> put delete user first, only then settings etc. DONE
DONE 175. delete AppWrapper DONE
DONE 175.5 auth -> zustand, other central state -> context. unify? check downsides of using context
context placement updated in app structure. DOWNSIDEs: it the notes, seems to be ok in this app  DONE
DONE 175.75 check if all contexts are used!!! backgroundImgContext adn authContext not being used
(AuthContext deleted) DONE
DONE 176. objects as props in more places? like paddingProps in Main (Main & MainRoute improved)DONE
DONE 177. useAuth zustand hook -> loginErrorMessage -> delete or implement? (deleted) DONE
DONE 178. after registering & redirecting to login -> focus should be set on password DONE
DONE 179. after registering -> register fields should be emptied DONE
xxx 180. focus should be on first field after clicking Login or Register (good-enough)xxx
  X 182. wiki-speed-typing - better login/register looks? (good enough) X
  X 183. login/register modals -> name of the app should be visible somewhere?
  (goodEnough - visible on the tab) X
??? 184. Profile_Input passedRef -> check agains BackgroudnSettings_Upload ???
DONE 185. common upper component for login-register, passwordforgotten & passwordChange (AuthOuterComponent added) DONE
DONE 187. option to make passwords visible! DONE
xx 190. PasswordForgotten  / forgotPasswordMutation -> more consistent naming? (good enough) xx
DONE 191. PasswordForgotten -> forgotPasswordMutation should return false sometimes and it should be handled?
to get info clientside that there is no regisered user DONE
DONE !!! 192. email with all .env codes !!! uj DONE
DONE 195. displaying res.error.message for graphql errors if it is present? [no but sth should be display clientside accordingly?] 
(2 times in LoginRegister, ForgottenPassChange & PasswordForgotten. PasswordForgotten & login in LoginRegister -> simpler logic) DONE
DONE 196. test changePasswordAfterForgot mutation by deleting user in the meantime DONE
xx 197. ForgottenPassChange should display user name?? (goodEnough)xxx
DONE 198. Login pass forgot -> should be below Login btn? (done + margin changes) DONE
DONE 200. tabs reset to default: in auth version happens in Grid, in non-auth in Tab -> unify?
non-auth: defaultTabContent was taken from context and passed to each individual tab contexts
tabVisDispatch({ type: "TAB_CONTENT_DEFAULT" }) was used in every individual tab ("TAB_CONTENT_DEFAULT" to delete?)
(non-auth logic also being handled in grid, "TAB_CONTENT_DEFAULT" & defaultTabContent for useTabs deleted) DONE
DONE 201. tabIdsUsedByBookmarks -> MERN -> created every time in one of Grid's useEffect (check EditTab_main editTab wrapper also)
old not-auth -> placed in central bookmarks state. check if it works properly, unify? (auth and non auth logis now in SingleBookmark only) DONE
DONE 202. Grid tabDeletingPause introduced in MERN version -> can/should it be implemented for non-auth version also? (
  tab deleting pause is no more! it was used for old logic of empty tab deletion) DONE
DONE 204. all userIdOrNoId logic -> convert to ? : DONE
DONE 206. useBookmark -> change ids in the starting data for nonAuth to strings? DONE
DONE 207. (pushed -> solve auth non-auth problems with bookmarks & tabs first) NewBookmark_UpperUI
 -> ts-ignore had to be user 2x -> why?? (1 ts-ignore less, more separated logic between auth and notAuth) DONE 
DONE !!!!! 207. SingleBookmark -> implement icon fallback for nonAuth Version! DONE
DONE 208. BackgroundSettings-> if no userId -> implement logic to suggest creating an account
BackgroundSettings_Upload doesn't have to be touched though? code won't be executed DONE
DONE 209. settings should be unified? add null userId and null to non-auth version?
 (GlobalSettingsState, notAuth verision has empty string for id and userId, UseGlobalSettingsState include setGlobalSettingsState
  SettingsDatabase_i on the server extends GlobalSettingsState, but it is the same)DONE
DONE 210. BackgroundSettings_Upload -> instead of hidden class - do not render in in BackgroundSettings render function DONE
DONE 211. make non-auth data persist in local storage DONE
?? 212. Bookmark_local tab_indices - is it needed? (no tab indices use, tabIds used instead)??
DONE 213. (pushed -> solve auth non-auth problems with bookmarks & tabs first) () SingleBookmark
 -> interface for nonAuth is being used also for auth?? the one for auth being not used (fixed one mistake in assigning interfaces)DONE
DONE 214. delete userIdOrDemoId DONE
DONE 215. (first bug fixes for nonAuth version)  DONE new bookmark DONE, DONE resetToDefaul DONE , allTags when hidden problem, DONE cannot edit tab DONE, DONE cannot delete bookmars DONE 
DONE 216. allTabsFolder when hidden problem -> taking too much space!? check in auth and non-auth versions
(tabIsDeletable hidden logic from Tab extended to GapAfterTab) DONE 
DONE 217. tab deletion confirmation -> implement? (folder would be ok, but especially losing notes accidentaly would be bad) DONE
DONE 218. check localStorage for auth version (local storage works for nonauth version only) DONE 
DONE 219. notes -> should be reworked, so they can be edited in place?
 (middleground solution -> tab is open when edit is clicked, this allows 8 rows instead of 4) DONE
DONE 220. auth version problems after implementing, non auth version: DONE
DONE 221. color hooks - to be partially deleted? (resetColors and tabBeingDragged remained) DONE 
! DONE 222. update App structure - routes! contexts! eg.tabcontext -> for each individual tab!
(sapling vscode extension! helped) DONE !
DONE 222. LoginSuccessfull notification (Message) ->  not showing after login! (done - switched to central state, instead of context)
logoutMessage -> to delete? does not have a chance to be set because of routing (deleted)
blinking after user deletion! login gets redisplayed  if its display did not finish (done -> setting message to null in UserProfile) DONE
DONE 223. rssSettings problem -> value lower than 5 and 15 can be entered! no easy way to increase/decrese value?? DONE
DONE 224. tabDeletingPause in Grid -> hack? explain how it works
tabDeletingPause is no more -> it was used before to delete empty tab before deleting the last of its bookmark DONE
DONE 225 (pushed). is aria-label present in all btns? DONE
x 227. mutations -> sometimes the graphql args are listed, Fields should be imported and spread instead?
Fields in userType & args -> should they always be the same? (no, it only for convenience) x
DONE 229. Browser error: Default Client: No client has been specified using urql's Provider.This means that urql will be falling back to defaults including making requests to `/graphql`.
If that's not what you want, please create a client and add a Provider. (fixed be deleting unused code in App)DONE 
DONE 232. rss local -> changing global rss settings is not being reflected immediately
(if a setting has been changed locally, even after reseting to default)!! (
  auth version also didn't worked, code reworked) DONE
DONE 234. rss itemPerPage -> cannot be set by keyboard to more than 9 -> problem? (solved by making changes on refocus) DONE
DONE 235. non-auth version problem with less column settings-> missing content? DONE
DONE 240. (rethink again - slow performance!?) bookmarks are rendered only after tab is open ->
 maybe they should be just hidden instead? (done for notes also) DONE
xx 242. utils folder server code -> move up? xx
DONE 243. background color no pic -> rectangle instead of doc svgs, should be filled with color? DONE
DONE 244. ts generated file -> get rid of it? (deleted, uninstalled, made note in notes about it) DONE
DONE 245. fetch RSS query file & graphql -> to delete (rssquery type & rss code in client's graphqlQueriers deleted) DONE
DONE 247. haslo do gmaila (adres to nodemailera) wyslac DONE
DONE 248. update queries mutation examples DONE
DONE 250. login after registering -> "user does not exiss" doen't clean, test all possibilities DONE
DONE 251. custom backgroundImg name is not displayed when going to backgroundImg options in case it is selected before
(also - wasCustomClicked logic deleted)DONE
DONE  253. backgroundImg folders not being deleted from the app after user deletion! 
DONE 255. request in mutation in queries -> unify type (RequestWithAuth everywhere) DONE
(only deleteUserByAdminMutation was not working, fixed - recursive true) DONE
x 257. no authHeader isAuth error console log repeats to many times -> too many redners somewhere?
 (it's fine, as the message sits in isAuth middleware)x
DONE 258. where is res in login and logout coming from -> console.log it 
(see notes, request is passed to graphql resolver, res seems to be added to request object) DONE
DONE 259. !!! UserProfile does not show on smaller browser window!!! (wrong code in UpperRightMenu_XS) DONE
x 260. UpperUI comp to delete? (it is still used, even though UpperRightMenu & UpperLeftMenu are being attached to Column now) x 
xxx 262. after modifing note -> make the empty space below columns smaller? (no need - different solution - #219)xxx
DONE -not poss to change col colors
DONe
-n p to change to normal background
- not poss to add bookmark, tabs itp for the top menu
- not possible to change settings
DONE
But possible to edit bookmarks, delete, drag
& possible to add bookmarks, tabs in the lower Ui,
& possible to edit folders
DONE background Color possible now in no pic mode
DONE 264. refreshToken bad request when not logged in -> works, but it should be without error
(actually this is the error send be server code, changed to 401) DONE
DONE 265. note cannot be empty -> works only in auth version for now (
  in fact both were not working -> textarea value consisting of only space characters was allowed) DONE
DONE 265.5 adding newTab when adding new Bookmark by lower UI (upper ui workd) results in an emptY tab! (in non auth version only) \
(adding tab logic in lowerUI fixed, code order fixed to be similar to upperUi)DONE
DONE 268. add some text, explanation in email with pass change (
one sentence is now visible, seems both text & html field should contain the same message
for different clients to read)DONE
DONE 269. changePassword (after clicking token from email) - make better lower margin, too small? 
(some spaces changed before)DONE
DONE 270. changePassword (after clicking token from email) - implement hide/show password, passVisible props DONE
DONE 271. tokenVersion -> why not present in UserField? (UserFields are use in UserType & AddUserType
in the 2nd case tokenVersion is not returned (to the client), Changed UserType to include tokenVersion,
 also other interfaces is userType changed) DONE
DONE 272. authNotification -> change from colors in props to "error" of "notification" types (colors inside component) DONE
DONE 273. router keys control (escape) does not work - current code is an old code for client demo,
the logic should use router, check if handleKeyDown in AuthOuterComponent is enough, delete it in children DONE
!x 275.zustand -> get() or state. (get() is for getting value but not for changing it)  x!
DONE 276. Lock as opened by default (confusing!) -> Opened/Closed by default? (Default content visibility 2x eye svgs) DONE
DONE 277. Default content visibility -> works differently in auth and non-auth version!(changing state immediately in non-auth) DONE
DONE 278 Transparent colors for columns
Choose default image: 1 2 3  -> more space between those 2 lines, 1st one should function as"backgroung img on" description DONE

DONE 283. clear svgs (logout for sure) (globeAlt also deleted) DONE
DONE 284. RESET tabs to default -> change text DONE
DONE 285. make the UpperRightMenu_XS the default way? (if not, check if height on md: is okay, was changed by #286)

DONE 286. make the 3 settings modals appear always at the same height (important on a xs screen) DONE
DONE !287. implement empty tab deletion login in edit bookmark DONE
DONE 291. BackgroundSettings_Upload -> errors not implemented! bring back commented out code for error div (goodEnough -> both errors in one)DONE
DONE 291.5 Test uploading wrong type, too large files etc.DONE
DONE 294. upperUi modals -> make ColorsSettings width same as others (on larger screen), so it is easier to navigate DONE
DONE 295. ColorsSetting -> margins on the left? too spaced (layout reworked)DONE
DONE 297. colorsSettings focus on folder/rss/note after pressing escape DONE
DONE 298. ColorsSettings -> different border for dark colors selection DONE
DONE !!! 299. cannot move tabs by dragging !!! (Column -> nonAuth auth code fixes for LastGap)DONE
DONE 301.  delete aria-label where it is not needed -> eg. if the text inside the button tag is goodEnough (aria-labelled by
might have been used in few cases?)DONE

GOOD enough?
  no GraphQLNonNull used, good enough this time
  60. flickering when uploadin background img file
  1. livereload npm (to restart client if any changes in server is detected)
  guide to implement, not tested:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62403571/hot-reloading-in-a-react-app-with-express-server
  10. typescript doesn't work for schemas?
  manaul static methods with mongoose model methods inside them should be used? use sth different than mongoose - papr?
  done 51. fix any types (server.js multer?) (isAuth interface but not used in multer, backgroundImgResult types) done
  DONE 64. npm modules should be imported like: import multer = require("multer"). with const typescript types are not working!!
  change everywhere!!  (change with exception of jsonwebtoken, some ts-ignores added in server.ts,
  const instead of import in express.Router(), problems with mutation & query root see #246)DONE
  ? 96.server.ts unify -> different reponses, sometimes they are objects - not needed
  good enough? - rss & backgroundImg unified, token different but it is more complex ?
  x 104. multer.any() <- change to single("name") somehow 
  seems there is no way to validate if multer is used as a callback,
  it maybe possible if it was uses inside a graphql resolver
  https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/issues/301 x
  xxx 160. editUser -> update causes flickering due to reexecuting query (left, urql problem?) xxx
  xx 168. objectAssign -> convert to function? (good enough, but not type safe) xx
  xxx 170. AuthNotification components -> implement in UserProfile (good enough - AuthNotification would actually mean more codelines)xxx
  xx 174. development mode -> should work also when offline? (good enough)xx
  x 194. changePasswordAfterForgot -> in case of token expiration -> link to forgotpass should be visible (good enough) x
  xx 199. tabsDb and tabsNotAuth etc -> should be in props instead of taken out of Context every time? less code3
  (purpose of context/state management it to not think about props!)xx
  x 221. objCreators -> bookmarkNonAuth done wrong? id not needed in db version? (good enough, id is ignored later in
  addBookmarkMutation) x
  x 225. Disable drag & drop -> should be sth like disable drag & drop for tabs?? (make hover hints or put in about) x
  x 226. tabsData, bookmarkData, settignsData -> same as client but with userId? unify?  (good enough)x
  DONE 239. (pushed, same reason as above) bookmarks itp -> in the end ts is chosing the type by itself, even if it should be split type
  (before, bmarks & tabs changed 2 times to allow proper ids as keys for mapping, global setting interfaces overhaul, rest - good enough)) DONE
  xx 246. root mutation & query files -> fix types (after changin const to import) one of the mutation is done right - compare!
  (left as it is -> problem with GraphQLFieldResolver type, it wants ExpressReqRes before arguments in the resolve, code does not work is this ts error is gone) xx
  x 252. clientSIde reaction to rss and background img query errors? (goodEnough, rss is taken care of, img errot doesnt'
  break app, no background img is shown instead) x
  x 189 email with pass change ended once in span -> put warning to check spam? (put it in known issues of about section)x
  xx 274. ForgottenPassChange -> implement error if accessing the route through random characters in the url?
  (goodEnough as it now, easy way to access componetent)xx
  xx 296. consider making all settings the same width alwass (wider "tabs" in ColorsSettings made instead) xx
GOOD enough

TO implement in future versions?
  x 263. option to reset single Tab color to default? (goodEnough for now, all tabs have to reseted) x 
TO implement in future versions?


!46. bookmarks not up to date when adding newBookmark if there are none (auth vers only)
 -> hacky solution only, reexectuing query in Bookmarks which causes rerender - solve?
(possible solution to get rid of rerender at least -> no bookmarks in any of useeffect? diff way for calc. tabIdsUsedByBookmarks)
no useeffect using bookmarks
? 61. background img -> currently there is no point in storing it in db, as it is get from server only??
BackgroundImg schema in server.ts - does it work?? (!!! updade deleteUserMutation (x2) -> currently it is not deleting images!)
  (BackgroundImgSchema in server.ts does work -should it be deleted?, because querying is done from server only )   ?
68. list all links to free svgs in notes [one more svg may be implemented still]
126. didAuthError not needed? since there will be (!isAuth) logic in qraphql mutation/queries.
instead, willAuthError is needed? even if it does not trigger error (logic for refreshing is not needed in getAuth?), 
it will trigger refresh in getAuth
128. update token notes (refreshing tokens -> always two tokens are being refreshed, that is by design? probably)
129. implement willAuthError for better performance
130. improve getAuth -> it should not include refresh token logic in the first run?
139. wiki-speed-typing, take care of 138 issue!
149. more rigid password checking?
155. better email validation
188. wiki-speed-typing -> check if password retrival is available still

224. (pushed -> no hover field anywhere, but should it be introduced? or may be as display at hte top) 
globalSettings rss items number-> hover field, implement is alse elsewhere??
231. local development -> user has to be created on different pcs separetely or no backgroundImg??

167.(pushed) changeUserByAdmin and other mutations for admin  -> can it remain in production? test it after app is in production!! is it secure?
181. (pushed) clean db in the end

233. rrs itemsPerPage -> test on mobile! real one

281. write about Note, implement a way to bring it back?
292. SingleBookmark & Bookmark_lowerUi -> for db, the code for deleting empty is doubled, for notAuth -> all logic resides in useBookmarks. unify?
300. dbContext -> may be slowing down the app? test by changing context to central state?
 (other solution would involve not remembering state after closing the app. Solution -> move the logic to localStorage? )
302. aria-labelled by to use in few cases?

"urql": "^2.0.5"


firecamp upload mutation: 
variables should be like that:
{
  "image": ""
}

mutation ($image: Upload!) {
    backgroundImgMutation(image: $image)
  }

======================================
JWT logic: 

0. Login component -> login Mutation (see below -> res from the server contains the refresh token in a cookie and is setting it on client),
 access token & authenticatedUserId is taken from the server response is saved to central state

serverside: Login mutation (vars: name/email, password): 
1. searches db by name/email
2. check if password is valid
3. sends refresh token (first creates it) in a cookie? (from the server)
 - so client has a refresh token in a cookie set now!!
[refresh token is being send in a request only if hiting /refresh_token (point 6)]
4. creates accessToken, returns it so it can be stored in central state (point 0)

5. clientside (ApolloClient/urqlClient?):
 every request to the server is going to have access token (in the headers) taken from central state

6. clientside during every app reload:
 App.js is posting to /refresh_token route on the server,                           
  which verifies if client has a valid refresh token in a cookie,
  if yes -> 
    server creates new refresh token and sends it back
    server sends access token in a response from the server
    access token is stored clientside in memory (central state)

7. creating new access token if old expires -> Apollo middleware? what about urql??

8. mutation/queries are being protected by isAuth, which checks if accessTOken is valid

9. logOut -> setting empty string in a cookie instead of refresh token + setting access token to null clientside

...more, check


To so sum up, after login: 
1. Client has a cookie with refresh token (that is not being sent with every request, but only to /refresh_token endpoint),
access token is stored in client's memory (state manager)), and it is being sent in every request to the server (in headers)
(mutations/queries are being protected by isAuth on the server, which checks if there is proper accessToken set in the header)

2. app reload: post to /refresh_token route -> after validating if client has proper refresh token in a cookie, new refresh token & access token is being sent to client

3. creating new access token if old expires -> apollo middleware



urql auth:

login mutation: code from willAuthError won't run!
central state should be updated after jwt logic is handled??

setting nodemailer -> 2 step authentication in gmail -> setting app password

===========
mongo/schema etc .notes


server.ts -> graphql server from express-graphql, that takes a schema
schema -> root mutation & root query
individual mutations & queries -> using models from mongoModels folder (root of the app)

client -> graphql folder -> graphql queries for mutation & queries
















======================
other notes

backgroundSettings_Upload -> reexecute query works only after introducint async function!

react-tracked -> optimized rerender for zustand itp?

bookmarkAllTags purpose -> delete a Tab if its last bookmark is deleted



export interface AuthContextObj_i {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  authenticatedUserId: null | string;
  accessToken: null | string;
  loginNotification: null | string;
  loginErrorMessage: null | string;
}

export interface AuthContextZustand_i extends AuthContextObj_i {
  logout: () => void;
  loginAttempt: (
    isAuthenticated: boolean,
    userId: string,
    token: string
  ) => void;
}

import create from "zustand";

import { AuthContextZustand_i } from "../../utils/interfaces";

export const useAuth = create<AuthContextZustand_i>((set) => ({
  isAuthenticated: false,
  authenticatedUserId: null,
  accessToken: null,
  loginNotification: null,
  loginErrorMessage: null,
  logout: () => set(state => ({
      ...state,
      isAuthenticated: false,
      authenticatedUserId: null,
      accessToken: null
  })),
  loginAttempt: (isAuthenticated, userId, token) => set(state => ({
      ...state,
      isAuthenticated: isAuthenticated,
      authenticatedUserId: userId,
      accessToken: token
  }))

//   setLoggedInState: (trueOrFalse) =>
//     set((state) => ({
//       ...state,
//       loggedInState: trueOrFalse,
//     })),



}));

================  useCallback & useMemo
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback

useMemo - memoization
useCallback - memoization of functions
useCallback & useMemo (probably only!) usecases:

1. useEffect depedency are objects or functions
(if not, the useEffect will rerun every time the component rerenders, as even if the object is identical, it is not referentially equal)

2a (useMemo). optimizing unnecessary rerenders - if rerendering parent component causes unnecessary rerender of child component,
ex. if other child updates parent's state)
 -> most time you should not bother (unless they are sth heavy like animation)

2b (useCallback) optimizing unnecessary rerenders - if a function is passed from parent to child - it will cause child
to rerender if parent rerenders as the function will be new

3. (useMemo) computionally expensive calculations

====== passedRef
userd in LogRegProfile_input to focus on first field on component mount
parent component is using useEffect to focus on ref, which is passed to first LogRegProfile_input component

==== downsides & tips of using context
context will rerender any components that are using it,
even if they not use the value that has just changed. Should be used for data that
is changed with low frequency, should be kept relatively close in app structure,
 should be split to as many contexts as possible. seem to be ok in this app


====== grahql-codegen -> potentially v. usefull in the future
 "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^2.7.0",
  "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "2.2.2",
  "@graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers": "^2.6.7",


===== value being passed to graphql resolvers
  rootValue: A value to pass as the rootValue to the graphql() function from GraphQL.js/src/execute.js.
    context: A value to pass as the context to the graphql() function from GraphQL.js/src/execute.js.
    differences:
    "Generally, the context value is information that is useful at any point during query execution. A canonical example
    is the current logged in user. The root value represents the "top" of your metaphorical graph of data, and is useful
    to include functions or data to help resolve the root fields in your schema."

     If context is not provided, the request object is passed as the context.
    !!!  It seems that the response (as res) is added to this request object (is is being used in loginMutation & logoutMutation)


==== file upload system

- image is being send in graphql mutation with  UploadFileType, resolver is not being used.
Image is attached as a request body
- multer is being used as a middleware in server.ts -> it runs everytime there is a body in a request, and if the user if authenticated
(req.isAuth)
- image is being saved not in a db, but on the server! (in backgroundImgs folder)

== file query:
backgroundImgQuery in Main is generating url with users id in it, this url is passed to MainRoute
In MainRoute an express route is using the passed url to return file from the server
