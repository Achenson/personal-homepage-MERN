notes:

1. in GraphQL, all types are nullable by default!


 issues:
 
 DONE 2. working graphql playground DONE
 DONE 5. bookmarkSchema.ts: is <Array> type enough? [string] DONE 
 DONE 3. id: string | number or string only? unify with client (client: string only) DONE
 
 1. livereload npm
 2. adding user doesn't return anything on graphql playground? (but it returns in changeSettings)
 4. client: SingleTabData: [object] | never[] | [] ????  <- not being used actually in the client?
 6. userSchema gets ref to settingsSchema, should it be also the other war around?
 7. client: bookmarksData -> change id to strings only?
 8. client: ALL_TAGS should not be an id but rather a tab type! ids will be added automatically be database
 9. deleteUser -> promise.all should be used instead of individual promises? for performance
10. typescript doesn't work for schemas?
11. deleteTabMutation -> should it also delete related Bookmark automatically?
12. change args to ...Type
13. tabType: deletable -> was is used clienside? if not it can be used instead of "ALL_TAGS: type !
14. non-null types: same everywhere!
15. fields -> id can be an argument even if it is never used? delete it from fields?
16. upserts in changeMutations -> should be false mostly?
